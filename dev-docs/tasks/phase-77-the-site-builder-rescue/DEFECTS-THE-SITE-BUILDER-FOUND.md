# Defects the site builder found

**Richard, 2026-08-28** (stated on phase 78, and general): *"If you find a problem with the
codebase or MCP or whatever, add it to the next session prompt to fix please. We're making
templates to surface bugs and issues with the whole NodeGX concept as well."*

Phase 77 had no such file for its first ten sessions — its product findings were recorded inside
task files as notes and acceptance criteria, which is where they go to be *understood* and not
where they go to be *fixed*. This is the standing register for phase 77, and the sibling of
[phase 78's](../phase-78-the-templates/DEFECTS-THE-TEMPLATES-FOUND.md).

🔴 **Scope: the product, not the template.** A wire missing from the site-builder's own graph is
a template fix and belongs in an SBR task. A row here is something **any** NodeGX user hits.

## House rules

- 🔴 **A row is a measurement, not an impression.** Say what was done and what happened.
- ⚠️ **Disproved candidates stay, marked.** They stop the next person re-deriving them.
- Each row names **where it bites a person**.
- Each row says whether it has an **owner**. "No owner" is the thing this file exists to fix.

## D1 — 🔴 Nothing anywhere warns that a node's `Failure` reaches nobody

**Severity: high. No owner.** Found by SBR-015 (s10).

In a cloud function a `Failure` that reaches no `noodl.cloud.response` is not a degraded
result — it is a **thirty-second hang**, because the request only ends when something sends.
`publishPage` and `duplicatePage` shipped in a real template with **zero** failure wires between
them, and neither the door nor the editor said a word.

Measured:

| where a check could live | what is there |
|---|---|
| MCP door (`noodl-mcp/src/validate.ts`) | **no rule about outcome or failure wiring** — the word `failure` appears twice, both unrelated |
| editor warnings (`WarningsModel`) | nothing for an unconnected outcome port |
| runtime | NDA-012 / ERG-001 made every node **report** a failure on its outcome ports and the error channel — but nothing checks that an author **wired anyone to listen** |

🔴 **The Failure Contract solved the half that was in the runtime's gift and left the half that
is in the author's.** A node that reports perfectly into an unwired port is exactly as silent as
one that never reported.

**Where it bites:** an admin clicks Publish, watches a spinner for thirty seconds, is told
nothing, and the page is not published. The one outcome downstream cannot react to.

**Suggested shape:** a door diagnostic — `failure-reaches-nothing` — over any component holding a
`noodl.cloud.request`. SBR-015 ships this rule as a **template-scoped test**
(`sb007Template.test.ts`), which protects this one template and no user. ⚠️ Grade the failure
**edge**, not the node: "does this node reach a Response?" is true of every node on a happy path
and would pass the unfixed graph. Same family as phase 78's D1.

## D2 — 🔴 A cloud function's node steps are never recorded, so the execution log cannot say *where* it hung

**Severity: medium-high. No owner.** Found by SBR-015 (s10).

`executions.sqlite` has an `execution_steps` table with a full schema — `node_id`, `node_type`,
`node_name`, `step_index`, `status`, `error_message`. After the SBR-006 drive it held **3
executions and 0 steps**.

⚠️ **The first two readings of this were wrong and are kept as the correction.** It is *not*
that nothing writes the table, and *not* that the recorder is unimplemented:
`ExecutionLogger.startNode()` / `completeNode()` are complete, and they **do** have callers —
`WorkflowEngine.ts:524` and `WorkflowRunner.ts:261`. The defect is narrower and only visible
once you look for the caller: **step recording is wired to the workflow engine, and a cloud
function's graph is run by a different executor that never calls it.** The execution-level row
*is* written (the dispatcher calls `startExecution`), so the feature is half-wired rather than
absent — which is why the table looks like a bug in the logger and is not one.

**Where it bites:** this table is the fastest way to tell "never called" from "called and
failed", and SBR-006 reached for it first exactly as intended. For a cloud function it can say
*that* one hung and never *where* — which is what made SBR-015 cost a whole session.

## D3 — ⚠️ `completed` reads as success, and the product has already been told so once

**Severity: medium. No owner.** Found by SBR-015 (s10).

`completed` *"fires after every invocation, whatever the outcome"* (`outcome.ts`). Wired into a
record write or a Response's `send` it therefore reports success **after a failure**. In the
shipped template it had been wired into both: `publishPage` marked a page `published` after a run
that set no section's access rules.

🔴 **This is a recurrence, not a discovery.** `outcome.ts`'s own FH-022 / TALK-006 note records
Richard hitting the `done`/`completed` pair on `Condition` and reading two identically-behaving
ports as the vocabulary doubling up. The repair then was **wording**. This is the same confusion
arriving with a data-integrity consequence, which is evidence the wording fix did not reach far
enough.

**Where it bites:** a site owner sees a page listed as published that no visitor can read.

⚠️ **Do not "fix" this by banning `completed`** — two uses in the same file are correct and
documented (an unprovisioned secret must still reach the picker; a bounced mail must still answer
the visitor). The rule is about **where it lands**.

## D4 — ⚠️ A refused query and an empty collection are the same screen

**Severity: medium. Owner undecided — Richard's call (SBR-006 §5.8 or SBR-010).**

On a cold load with no session the admin page list renders the shell, the heading and `New page`
and nothing else: no rows, and no row-count sentence, because `count` runs on `pages.fetched` and
a refused query never fires it. No "no pages yet", no "you are not signed in".

**Where it bites:** two states with opposite fixes are pixel-identical, and the screen reads as
broken in both. The product gives an author no ready way to tell them apart.

## Collected from earlier phase-77 sessions

Recorded in task files at the time, gathered here so they are findable as **work**. Attributed to
the session that measured them; not re-measured in s10.

| id | defect | measured | owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| D5 | 🔴 The NDA-017 migration writes `runOnChange-*: false` on load for **every** node whose control signal is wired — 37 nodes in a fresh project, zero `true`s. An explicit `true` survives; absent does not. Caused the site's root URL to render no page at all. | SBR-004 §9.2, s8 | template fixed; **the migration itself has no owner** |
| D6 | ⚠️ `maxWidth` is **inert on `Text`** — authored, driven (`computed: none`), removed. | SBR-004 §9.3, s5/s8 | none |
| D7 | ⚠️ `Text` declares **no padding ports and no `borderRadius`** — margins only. A padded nav item needs a wrapping `Group`. | SBR-006, s9 | none |
| D8 | ⚠️ A bare number in a dimension port means **percent** (`width: 240` → `240%`). The door refuses it; the object form is the fix. Easy to write, hard to see. | SBR-006, s9 | none |
| D9 | 🔴 The deploy drops **wire-only** `prop-*` — a parameter survives, a wire does not. | SB-017 §11.1 / SBR-006 §5.6 | **SBR-008** ✅ |
| D10 | ⚠️ A signal into a **value** port writes true-then-false, and the input queue holds one entry per input name, so the two coalesce and the consumer runs **once, with `false`**. | SBR-002, s4b | template fixed; runtime behaviour unowned |

⚠️ **D5–D8 and D10 are listed from their task files and have not been re-verified.** Re-measure
before acting — several are a phase old and the platform has moved under them.
