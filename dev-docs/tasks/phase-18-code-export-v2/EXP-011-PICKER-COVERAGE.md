# EXP-011 — Close the picker gap, ranked by what apps need

**Status:** 🟡 In progress — **Tier 1.4 (the value Variables) is built, driven and gated**, session 35
**Depends on:** nothing — but sequenced after EXP-009 and EXP-010, which are worth more per hour
**Replaces:** every "what to build next" list in this phase from sessions 20–31

---

## §1 The gap, measured

```
node scripts/export-ledger/picker-coverage.js
```

> **PICKER COVERAGE: 55 of 127 placeable nodes export (43.3%)** — 2026-08-28, session 35
> (51 / 40.2% when this task was written; **Variables** has left the table below)

| category | nodes a user can place and cannot export |
|---|---|
| **Data** | 27 |
| **Utilities** | 16 |
| **Cloud Services** | 9 |
| **Navigation** | 5 |
| Visual · Component Utilities | 3 · 3 |
| CustomCode · Animation · String Manipulation | 2 · 2 · 2 |
| Interpolation · Math · Logic | 1 · 1 · 1 |

The full list regenerates from the script; do not paste it into docs where it will go stale.

## §2 First, fix the corpus — this task is worthless without it

🔴 **Do not rank this work with `coverage-audit.ts` / `rank2.ts`.** That is the instrument that
cost this phase twelve sessions (README § *What went wrong*). It is weighted by ~40 old drive
fixtures, 83% of its remaining complaints are one unplaced third-party Noodl prefab, and it is
structurally blind to any node those projects never used — which is most of this gap.

The corpus stays as a **regression net**. Alongside it, build a small set of projects that exist
to exercise the picker:

- Built in the **0.2.0 editor** and by the **MCP**, not hand-edited JSON.
- One per gap cluster below, each a small app that a person would plausibly build.
- Each placed on a routed page and actually rendering — session 31 found 20% of the old corpus is
  in components no route reaches, which is code no metric should be counting.
- Added to `projects.txt` and to `build-corpus.ts`, so they gate.

**A slice is not done until a project in this set exports and runs.**

## §3 The ranking, by what an app needs

Ranked by *"can you build a normal app without it"*, not by corpus frequency.

### Tier 1 — an ordinary app hits these on day one

1. **The client-side data vocabulary (Data, ~10 of the 27).** `Object`, `Set Object Properties`,
   `Create New Array`, `Clear Array`, `Remove Object From Array`, `Array Filter`, `Array Map`,
   `Repeater Item`. This is how anyone holds a working set of rows in the UI. It is also the
   honest, NodeGX-shaped version of the `Model2` work sessions 17–31 kept circling — with the
   difference that this time it is aimed at what the picker offers, not at a legacy prefab's use
   of it. **[EXP-002-MODEL2-TARGET-OUTPUT.md](./EXP-002-MODEL2-TARGET-OUTPUT.md) §4's design is
   still good and should be reused; §2, §3 and §7's ranking are void.**
2. **`HTTP Request`.** Any app that talks to anything that is not its own backend.
3. **The date family (Utilities, 6).** `Now`, `Date To String`, `Date Add`, `Date Compare`,
   `Date Difference`, `Date Parts`. Anything with a timestamp needs at least two of these.
4. ✅ **`String` / `Number` / `Boolean` / `Color` (Variables, 4).** The plain value nodes. Cheap, and
   embarrassing to be missing. **Built, driven and gated in session 35 — §6.**

### Tier 2 — common, not universal

5. **Navigation (5).** `Page Inputs` is the important one — no path parameters means no detail
   pages. Then `Navigate To Path`, `External Link`, the component stack pair.
6. **Cloud Services (9).** Mostly **unblocked by EXP-009**, and several may fall out of it for
   free — `Cloud Function`, `Record`, `Set User Properties`, `Sign In With`. Re-measure after
   EXP-009 lands rather than planning against today's list.
7. **String/Math utilities (4).** `Substring`, `String Mapper`, `Number Remapper`, `UUID`.

### Tier 3 — real, but a smaller audience

8. **`States` and `Animate To Value`** — the animation pair. Genuinely hard (they are time-based
   and stateful) and worth doing properly rather than early.
9. **`CSS Definition` and `Script`** — global CSS and arbitrary script. `CSS Definition` looks
   trivial and ⚠️ **every instance in the current corpus is the empty stub `".group1 "`, so it
   would buy nothing measurable there** — build it against a real project, not the corpus.
10. **`Component Children`, `Drag`, `Component Stack`, the parent-object family.**

### Not a target

`Action Dispatcher` / `Action Handler`, `Optimistic Update`, `State History` / `Undo / Redo`,
`Stream Buffer`, `SSE`, `WebSocket`, `JSON Stream Parser`, `Parse CSV` / `To CSV`,
`Pattern Extractor`, `Text Accumulator`, `Run Tasks`, `On App Error`, `Screen Resolution`,
`Gyroscope`, `Open File Picker`, `Random Bytes`, `Hash`.

These are real nodes and some are excellent, but they are specialist. **Say so in the ledger's
exemption sentence** rather than leaving them looking like a backlog — an exemption that names a
node as deliberately out of scope is a decision; one that says "pre-gate backlog" is a to-do
nobody will ever do. Most of the current 101 exemptions say the latter, verbatim.

## §4 Acceptance criteria

1. ✅ **The picker number moves and holds.** Every slice raises `pickerCoverageFloor` in the same
   commit — `export-ledger:picker` fails if it does not. *(51 → 55, session 35.)*
2. 🟡 **Tier 1 complete ⇒ 51 → ~72 of 127 (≈57%).** Tiers 1+2 ⇒ ≈87 (≈68%). Everything except the
   "not a target" list ⇒ ≈108 (≈85%). *(1.4 of 4 done; 1.1–1.3 remain.)*
3. ✅ **Each slice has a picker-exercising project** that exports, builds and runs (§2).
   *(Tier 1.4's is `tests/fixtures/variable-dial` — §6.4.)*
4. ✅ **The exemption sentences get rewritten** so that "deferred" means one of *deliberately out of
   scope* (with the reason) or *scheduled* (with the tier), never "pre-gate backlog".
   *(All 97, session 35, and `export-ledger:check` now enforces the shape — §6.5.)*

## §5 A standing rule for this task

**Rank by the picker; verify against a project someone would actually build; never let the corpus
choose the work.** If a future session finds itself reading a deferral census to decide what to do
next, it has taken the wrong turn — that census answers "did I break anything", and nothing else.

---

## §6 Tier 1.4 as built — the value Variables (session 35, 2026-08-28)

**51 → 55 of 127 (40.2% → 43.3%).** `pickerCoverageFloor` raised in the same commit;
`export-ledger:picker --check` holds it.

### §6.1 What a value Variable turned out to be

The four nodes are one definition — `variablebase.createDefinition` — so they are one translation
with a four-row cast table, and the shape a node takes is decided **by its wires, not by its type**:

| the author's graph | what is emitted |
|---|---|
| nothing wired into `value`, nothing into `Set` | **a constant.** The read folds to a literal, cast exactly as the runtime casts it. No `useState`. String's `Length` folds with it |
| `value` wired, Run On Value Change ticked (the default) | **a `useState` + a sync effect** carrying `setValueTo`'s table: `undefined` abstains, `null` stores the `Treat empty as` coercion, otherwise `args.cast` |
| `Set` wired | **deferred, named** — see §6.3 |

Three details were the runtime being specific rather than the export being clever, and each is a
test:

- **An unauthored node reports its `startValue`,** because `initialize` seeds `currentValue` and a
  *declared default never runs a setter* (`run-on-value-change.ts` says so in its own comment). An
  untouched `Color` panel is `#f1f2f4`, not undefined.
- **`NaN` is banned as a stored value outright.** `Number("cake")` takes the `Treat empty as`
  coercion instead, because `NaN !== NaN` would break the runtime's own `changed` guard forever.
  This is emitted in the effect *and* folded over an authored literal, and the drive watched it
  happen in a live page (§6.4).
- **Absent means ticked.** `runOnChange-value` is unticked only by a deliberate `false`. Reading
  absent as unticked would have deferred every node whose author never opened the panel — which is
  most of them.

The row's type is narrowed by the panel: `Treat empty as: Zero` makes the row `number`, not
`number | null`, because with that ticked nothing can write a null into it.

### §6.2 The one thing that was nearly wrong

`resolveExpr` runs **speculatively**, and a sync effect is referenced *unconditionally* at emit
(`component.ts`'s `referencedStateNames` sweep adds every `sync.stateName` whether or not a
binding survived). Pushing the effect where the read resolved would have emitted a `useState` and
a `useEffect` that no line of the component reads, on any node whose read was later dropped — the
dead-`useSession` trap this file already warns about, one construct over. The effect is pushed in
the **verdict sweep** instead, which runs after every binding pass and therefore knows the node
actually collapsed. `tests/variables.test.ts` closes with the control that says so.

### §6.3 What is deliberately outside the slice, and why it is not laziness

**`Set` (`saveValue`).** With it wired the node stops writing through and parks arrivals in
`latestValue`; the store is then *the value that last arrived, cast, unless it was `undefined`*.
That is an abstain guard **and** a cast wrapped around a value expression, and `state-set` carries
an expression with room for neither. Faking it would store an uncast `undefined` where the
interpreter stores nothing. The emitted report names it in the author's terms.

Also deferred, each with its own sentence: a consumed `Changed`/`done`/`unchanged` (the latch
rule, for the latch's reason); an unticked Run On Value Change with no `Set`, where nothing would
ever store; a `Value` fed by a handler-only read; and `Length` over a *stored* string, where the
expression vocabulary has no member access.

### §6.4 The project (§2's requirement), and the drive

`tests/fixtures/variable-dial` — **Variable Dial**, authored through the MCP server (not by
hand-editing JSON), one routed page, every node placed on it. It carries all three shapes at once:
three mirrors off one Variable, five folded constants, and one deliberate `Set` deferral.

It exports, builds under `tsc -b && vite build`, and runs. Driven in headless Chrome over CDP,
reading the DOM back after real keystrokes:

```
boot         : ["Variable Dial","","0","Bring cake","10","42","var(--primary)","Badge is on.",""]
typed "cake" : […,"cake","0","You typed something.",…]      ← Number("cake") → NaN → banned → 0
typed "42"   : […,"42","42","You typed something.",…]       ← the Number cast
cleared      : […,"","0",…]                                  ← the flag unmounts, Boolean("") is false
after latch  : [… ,""]                                       ← the deferred Set readout stays empty
console errs : []
```

🔴 **Every row observes a consequence, not a mechanism.** The emitted source already *says*
`String(arrival)`; a `toContain` over it would pass on dead code. The golden in
`tests/variables.test.ts` is pinned to this exact file, so what the suite holds is the artefact
whose behaviour was watched.

⚠️ **The empty readouts are load-bearing.** `innerText` collapses them away — the drive reads
`textContent` per `<p>` so that "the deferred latch shows nothing" is an observation rather than
an absence nobody looked for.

### §6.5 AC4, done — and gated

All **97** deferred ledger entries now open with either `deliberately out of scope — <reason>` or
`scheduled — <tier and why>`. 95 of them said `pre-gate backlog` verbatim before this, which is
how a whole vocabulary sits unexported while the ledger looks maintained.

`scripts/export-ledger/check.js` now **enforces the shape**, so it cannot drift back. The gate was
proved with a control pair before being believed: the real ledger passes, and one entry reverted
to the old sentence fails it with that entry named.

Where §3's ranking did not name a node (`Boolean To String`, `Delay`, `Log`, `Value Changed`,
`Color Blend`, the record-relation verbs, `Unique Id`), the entry **says the tier was assigned in
session 35 rather than by §3** — a tiering nobody ruled on should not read as one somebody did.
