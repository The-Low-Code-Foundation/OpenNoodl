title: "Dropdown"
---
Dropdown control: selects one value from an items list, exposing the selection as a string value.

The Dropdown renders a select control fed by an items list (label/value pairs, statically configured or bound from an array). The selected entry's value comes out on `value` (string level); `onChange` fires per user selection. Styling, `enabled`, and interaction states follow the standard controls surface.

## When to use it

One-of-many choices too numerous or space-constrained for radio buttons: country pickers, sort orders, categories. For two or three visible-at-once options prefer a Radio Button Group.

| `alignY` | Enum (`top`, `center`, `bottom`) | — | Vertical alignment of this element within the space its parent gives it |
| `backgroundColor` | Color | `transparent` | Fill colour of the closed dropdown; the open list is drawn by the browser and cannot be styled here |
| `blockTouch` | Boolean | — | Stops every pointer event that lands on this control from reaching the nodes it sits inside. Blunt: it takes hover and pointer-down with it, so reach for Click Bubbling first if it is only clicks you want to keep in |
| `borderBottomColor` | Color | — | Colour of the bottom edge only, overriding Border Color |
| `borderBottomLeftRadius` | Number | — | Rounds the bottom-left corner only, overriding Corner Radius |
| `borderBottomRightRadius` | Number | — | Rounds the bottom-right corner only, overriding Corner Radius |
| `borderBottomStyle` | Enum (`none`, `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`) | — | Line style for the bottom edge only, overriding Border Style; None hides that edge |
| `borderBottomWidth` | Number | — | Thickness of the bottom edge in pixels, and it adds to the element's size |
| `borderColor` | Color | `#000000` | Colour of the border, which has no effect while Border Style is None |
| `borderLeftColor` | Color | — | Colour of the left edge only, overriding Border Color |
| `borderLeftStyle` | Enum (`none`, `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`) | — | Line style for the left edge only, overriding Border Style; None hides that edge |
| `borderLeftWidth` | Number | — | Thickness of the left edge in pixels, and it adds to the element's size |

| `borderTopColor` | Color | — | Colour of the top edge only, overriding Border Color |
| `borderTopLeftRadius` | Number | — | Rounds the top-left corner only, overriding Corner Radius |
| `borderTopRightRadius` | Number | — | Rounds the top-right corner only, overriding Corner Radius |
| `borderTopStyle` | Enum (`none`, `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`) | — | Line style for the top edge only, overriding Border Style; None hides that edge |

| `clickBubbling` | Enum (`auto`, `always`, `never`) | `auto` | Whether a click on this control also fires Click on the nodes it sits inside. Automatic keeps it here as soon as this control's own Click is connected, so a Favourite button inside a clickable card runs Favourite and not the card; Always is the older behaviour where both run; Never keeps every click here, wired or not |

| `cssClassName` | String | `` | Extra CSS class names to put on this element, for styling from a stylesheet you supply |

## Dynamic ports

_This node's port list changes at runtime (declared-port-groups, runtime-discovered); the tables above may be incomplete for a given instance._

The port list above is complete — this node mints no ports. It republishes its own `value` input per instance as an `enum` built from this node's `items`: one choice per option, labelled with the option's `Label` and carrying its `Value`, plus the currently stored value when that matches no option. It is declared `string` statically because nothing outside a connected editor can know the instance's options.

## Ports at runtime

Declared-port-groups: the items source (static list vs bound array with label/value mappings), label ports and per-visual-state styling ports appear based on parameters. Bind `items` from an array to populate dynamically.

## Patterns

- Bind items from a Query Records/Static Array result; wire `value` into a filter input — a data-driven filter bar in three nodes.

## Examples

**Settings form: the standard input controls bound to values**

One of each core control: Text Input's live string comes out of `onTextChanged`, Checkbox exposes `checked` (level) plus `onChange` (edge), Dropdown (net.noodl.controls.options) takes an items list and emits the selected `value`, Slider (net.noodl.controls.range) emits a numeric `value` between `min`/`max`, and a Radio Button Group reports the `value` of whichever child Radio Button is selected. Values flow into a live summary — no submit step needed for value binding.
