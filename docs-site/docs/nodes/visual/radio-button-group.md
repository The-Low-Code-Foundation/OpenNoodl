title: "Radio Button Group"
---
Layout container that makes its child Radio Buttons mutually exclusive and outputs the selected value.

Radio Button Group is a flex container (like a Group) whose special duty is coordinating child Radio Buttons: exactly one can be checked, and the group's `value` output holds the `value` parameter of the selected one. `onChange` fires when the selection changes. Set `value` as an input to select programmatically.

## When to use it

Always wrap radio buttons in one — it is the single point logic should read. Nest plain Groups inside for layout; the grouping behaviour spans descendants.

## Inputs

### Values

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alignX` | Enum (`left`, `center`, `right`) | — | Horizontal alignment of this element within the space its parent gives it |
| `alignY` | Enum (`top`, `center`, `bottom`) | — | Vertical alignment of this element within the space its parent gives it |
| `cssClassName` | String | `` | Extra CSS class names to put on this element, for styling from a stylesheet you supply |
| `flexDirection` | Enum (`column`, `row`) | `column` | Stacks the radio buttons inside this group vertically or lays them out in a row |
| `height` | Dimension | `100` | Height of the element; how the value is read depends on Size Mode |
| `marginBottom` | Number | — | Space outside the element's bottom edge, between it and its neighbours |
| `marginLeft` | Number | — | Space outside the element's left edge, between it and its neighbours |
| `marginRight` | Number | — | Space outside the element's right edge, between it and its neighbours |
| `marginTop` | Number | — | Space outside the element's top edge, between it and its neighbours |
| `maxHeight` | Number | — | Largest height the element may grow to, taking priority over Height |
| `maxWidth` | Number | — | Largest width the element may grow to, taking priority over Width |
| `minHeight` | Number | — | Smallest height the element may shrink to, taking priority over Height |
| `minWidth` | Number | — | Smallest width the element may shrink to, taking priority over Width |
| `mixBlendMode` | Enum (`normal`, `multiply`, `screen`, `overlay`, `darken`, `lighten`, `color-dodge`, `color-burn`, `hard-light`, `soft-light`, `difference`, `exclusion`, `hue`, `saturation`, `color`, `luminosity`) | `normal` | How this element's colours blend with whatever is painted behind it |
| `mounted` | Boolean | `true` | Removes the element from the page entirely when false, unlike Visible which leaves its space behind |
| `opacity` | Number | `1` | How opaque this element is, from 0 for invisible to 1 for solid |
| `paddingBottom` | Number | `0` | Space inside the element's bottom edge, between it and its content |
| `paddingLeft` | Number | `0` | Space inside the element's left edge, between it and its content |
| `paddingRight` | Number | `0` | Space inside the element's right edge, between it and its content |
| `paddingTop` | Number | `0` | Space inside the element's top edge, between it and its content |
| `position` | Enum (`relative`, `absolute`, `sticky`, `fixed`) | `relative` | How the element is placed: In Layout follows its siblings, Absolute ignores them, Sticky pins to the parent edge on overflow, Fixed stays put and takes no space |
| `sizeMode` | Enum (`explicit`, `contentWidth`, `contentHeight`, `contentSize`) | `contentSize` | Whether Width and Height are used as given, or the element sizes itself to fit its contents |
| `styleCss` | String | `/* background-color: red; */` | Raw CSS declarations applied to this element, overriding the styling ports above |
| `transformOriginX` | Number | `50` | Horizontal point the element rotates and scales around, as a fraction of its width |
| `transformOriginY` | Number | `50` | Vertical point the element rotates and scales around, as a fraction of its height |
| `transformRotation` | Number | `0` | Rotates the element clockwise in degrees, without affecting the layout |
| `transformScale` | Number | `1` | Scales the element about its transform origin; 1 leaves it unscaled |
| `transformX` | Number | `0` | Moves the element right after layout, without moving its siblings |
| `transformY` | Number | `0` | Moves the element down after layout, without moving its siblings |
| `value` | String | — | Selects the radio button whose own Value matches this; setting it from the graph does not fire Changed |
| `visible` | Boolean | `true` | Hides the element while keeping the space it occupies in the layout |
| `width` | Dimension | `100` | Width of the element; how the value is read depends on Size Mode |
| `zIndex` | Number | — | Paint order among overlapping siblings; higher numbers paint on top |

## Outputs

### Values

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `boundingHeight` | Number | — | Height this element actually ended up with after layout, in pixels |
| `boundingWidth` | Number | — | Width this element actually ended up with after layout, in pixels |
| `childIndex` | Number | — | This element's position among its parent's children, counting from 0 |
| `childrenCount` | Number | — | How many child elements are currently mounted inside this one |
| `screenPositionX` | Number | — | Distance in pixels from the left edge of the window to this element's left edge |
| `screenPositionY` | Number | — | Distance in pixels from the top edge of the window to this element's top edge |
| `this` | Reference | — | A reference to this node itself, for ports that take a node rather than a value |
| `value` | String | — | Value of the radio button currently selected, or nothing if none is |

### Signals

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `didMount` | Signal | — | Fires once this element has been added to the page and can be measured |
| `onChange` | Signal | — | Fires when the user picks a different radio button; a value arriving on the Value input does not fire it |
| `willUnmount` | Signal | — | Fires just before this element is removed from the page, while it still exists |

## Dynamic ports

_This node's port list changes at runtime (declared-port-groups); the tables above may be incomplete for a given instance._

Declares conditional/expandable port groups whose visibility depends on parameter values (see declaredPortGroups).

| Condition | Inputs shown | Outputs shown |
|---|---|---|
| sizeMode = explicit OR sizeMode = contentHeight | `width` | — |
| sizeMode = explicit OR sizeMode = contentWidth | `height` | — |

## Ports at runtime

Declared-port-groups: sizing/layout port variants follow the size-mode parameters, as with other visual containers.

## Examples

**Settings form: the standard input controls bound to values**

One of each core control: Text Input's live string comes out of `onTextChanged`, Checkbox exposes `checked` (level) plus `onChange` (edge), Dropdown (net.noodl.controls.options) takes an items list and emits the selected `value`, Slider (net.noodl.controls.range) emits a numeric `value` between `min`/`max`, and a Radio Button Group reports the `value` of whichever child Radio Button is selected. Values flow into a live summary — no submit step needed for value binding.
