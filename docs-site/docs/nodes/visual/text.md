title: "Text"
---
Renders a piece of text with typography controlled by a text style or explicit font parameters.

Text displays the string on its `text` input. Typography comes either from a project-wide `textStyle` (preferred, keeps the app consistent) or from explicit `fontFamily`/`fontSize`/`color` parameters that override it. Like all visual nodes it sits in the children hierarchy, has size/margin/alignment parameters, and reports basic interaction signals (`onClick`, hover) and geometry.

## When to use it

Any static or data-bound text: headings, labels, list-item fields, error messages. Not for user-editable text (use net.noodl.controls.textinput) and not for button captions (the Button control has its own label).

## Inputs

### Values

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alignX` | Enum (`left`, `center`, `right`) | — | Horizontal alignment of this element within the space its parent gives it |
| `alignY` | Enum (`top`, `center`, `bottom`) | — | Vertical alignment of this element within the space its parent gives it |
| `as` | Enum (`div`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `p`, `span`) | `div` | HTML element to render the text as, which changes nothing visually but matters for screen readers and SEO |
| `blockTouch` | Boolean | — | Stops every pointer event that lands here from reaching the nodes this one sits inside. Blunt: it takes hover and pointer-down with it, so reach for Click Bubbling first if it is only clicks you want to keep in |
| `clickBubbling` | Enum (`auto`, `always`, `never`) | `auto` | Whether a click here also fires Click on the nodes this one sits inside. Automatic keeps it here as soon as this node's own Click is connected, so a button inside a clickable card runs the button and not the card; Always is the older behaviour where both run; Never keeps every click here, wired or not. Note that an element at zero opacity takes no pointer events at all |
| `color` | Color | — | Colour of the text itself, not of the element behind it |
| `cssClassName` | String | `` | Extra CSS class names to put on this element, for styling from a stylesheet you supply |
| `fontFamily` | Font | — | Typeface to render the text in, either a web-safe family name or a font file added to the project |
| `fontSize` | Number | — | Height of the text, in pixels |
| `height` | Dimension | `100` | Height of the element; how the value is read depends on Size Mode |
| `letterSpacing` | Number | `Auto` | Extra space added between characters; leave as Auto to use the spacing built into the font |
| `lineHeight` | Number | `Auto` | Vertical space each line of text occupies; leave as Auto to follow the font |
| `marginBottom` | Number | — | Space outside the element's bottom edge, between it and its neighbours |
| `marginLeft` | Number | — | Space outside the element's left edge, between it and its neighbours |
| `marginRight` | Number | — | Space outside the element's right edge, between it and its neighbours |
| `marginTop` | Number | — | Space outside the element's top edge, between it and its neighbours |
| `maxHeight` | Number | — | Largest height the element may grow to, taking priority over Height |
| `maxWidth` | Number | — | Largest width the element may grow to, taking priority over Width |
| `minHeight` | Number | — | Smallest height the element may shrink to, taking priority over Height |
| `minWidth` | Number | — | Smallest width the element may shrink to, taking priority over Width |
| `mixBlendMode` | Enum (`normal`, `multiply`, `screen`, `overlay`, `darken`, `lighten`, `color-dodge`, `color-burn`, `hard-light`, `soft-light`, `difference`, `exclusion`, `hue`, `saturation`, `color`, `luminosity`) | `normal` | How this element's colours blend with whatever is painted behind it |
| `mounted` | Boolean | `true` | Removes the element from the page entirely when false, unlike Visible which leaves its space behind |
| `opacity` | Number | `1` | How opaque this element is, from 0 for invisible to 1 for solid |
| `pointerEventsEnabled` | Boolean | `true` | When disabled, mouse and touch events pass through to whatever is behind this element |
| `pointerEventsMode` | Enum (`inherit`, `explicit`) | `inherit` | Whether pointer handling is inherited from the parent or set explicitly on this element |
| `position` | Enum (`relative`, `absolute`, `sticky`, `fixed`) | `relative` | How the element is placed: In Layout follows its siblings, Absolute ignores them, Sticky pins to the parent edge on overflow, Fixed stays put and takes no space |
| `sizeMode` | Enum (`explicit`, `contentWidth`, `contentHeight`, `contentSize`) | `contentHeight` | Whether Width and Height are used as given, or the element sizes itself to fit its contents |
| `styleCss` | String | `/* background-color: red; */` | Raw CSS declarations applied to this element, overriding the styling ports above |
| `text` | String | `Text` | The text to show; an empty value renders nothing rather than the words null or undefined |
| `textAlignX` | Enum (`left`, `center`, `right`) | `left` | Aligns the text within its own box on the horizontal axis |
| `textAlignY` | Enum (`top`, `center`, `bottom`) | `top` | Aligns the text within its own box on the vertical axis, which is only visible when the box is taller than the text |
| `textStyle` | TextStyle | `None` | Applies one of the project's saved text styles; the individual font ports below override whatever it sets |
| `textTransform` | Enum (`none`, `uppercase`, `lowercase`, `capitalize`) | `none` | Forces the text to upper case, lower case or capitalised without changing the underlying value |
| `transformOriginX` | Number | `50` | Horizontal point the element rotates and scales around, as a fraction of its width |
| `transformOriginY` | Number | `50` | Vertical point the element rotates and scales around, as a fraction of its height |
| `transformRotation` | Number | `0` | Rotates the element clockwise in degrees, without affecting the layout |
| `transformScale` | Number | `1` | Scales the element about its transform origin; 1 leaves it unscaled |
| `transformX` | Number | `0` | Moves the element right after layout, without moving its siblings |
| `transformY` | Number | `0` | Moves the element down after layout, without moving its siblings |
| `variant` | String | — | Name of a saved variant of this node type to apply, replacing the styling set here |
| `visible` | Boolean | `true` | Hides the element while keeping the space it occupies in the layout |
| `width` | Dimension | `100` | Width of the element; how the value is read depends on Size Mode |
| `wordBreak` | Enum (`normal`, `break-all`) | `normal` | Word break Control where line breaks are allowed - Normal: Break on spaces and other whitespace characters - Break All: Allow line breaks between any two characters, including inside words |
| `zIndex` | Number | — | Paint order among overlapping siblings; higher numbers paint on top |

## Dynamic ports

_This node's port list changes at runtime (declared-port-groups); the tables above may be incomplete for a given instance._

Declares conditional/expandable port groups whose visibility depends on parameter values (see declaredPortGroups).

| Condition | Inputs shown | Outputs shown |
|---|---|---|
| sizeMode = explicit OR sizeMode = contentHeight OR sizeMode NOT SET | `width` | — |
| sizeMode = explicit OR sizeMode = contentWidth | `height` | — |
| pointerEventsMode = explicit | `pointerEventsEnabled` | — |

## Ports at runtime

Text's ports are conditional on parameter values (declared-port-groups): explicit width/height ports appear only in the matching size mode, and advanced text ports depend on chosen options. Treat the catalog's list as the superset the editor filters contextually.

## Patterns

- Bind `text` from Component Inputs inside a Repeater item component to show per-record fields.
- Drive `visible` from a Condition's `result`/`isfalse` for inline error or empty-state messages.

## Examples

**List page: Repeater fed by Query Records**

The canonical data-list shape. Query Records (DbCollection2) fetches a database class and exposes the result on its `items` array output; the Repeater (For Each) consumes that array and instantiates its `template` component once per record. Each record's properties are delivered to the item component through Component Inputs whose names match the record's property names — the item component reads them like any other input. The Repeater and its item template component are separate components by design.

**Validate an input before acting on a click**

The idiomatic gate shape: a Button click does not act directly — it evaluates a Condition. The Condition's boolean comes from an Expression that checks the text input's current value, so the same click either proceeds (ontrue) or reveals an error message (isfalse drives the error Text's visibility as a level, not a pulse). Note the two kinds of flow: text/booleans are values, onClick/eval/ontrue are momentary signals.
