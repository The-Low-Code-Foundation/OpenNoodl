title: "Image"
---
Displays an image from a project asset or URL, with fit control, srcSet support and load/error signals.

Image renders an HTML `img` element. `src` takes a project asset path or a full URL (relative paths are resolved against the app's base URL); `srcSet` optionally provides responsive candidate images and `alt` the accessibility text. When `sizeMode` gives the image an explicit size, `objectFit` (Image Fit) chooses how the picture fills that box ('contain' by default, 'cover' for thumbnails). `onLoad` and `onError` are signals that fire when the browser finishes or fails loading the current source. It cannot have children and supports hover visual states for per-state styling.

## When to use it

Any bitmap content: photos, thumbnails, logos, user uploads (a cloud file output connects straight to `src`). For vector glyphs from an icon set use net.noodl.visual.icon; for a decorative background prefer a Group's background image/color so children can sit on top; for video use Video.

## Inputs

### Values

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `alignX` | Enum (`left`, `center`, `right`) | — | Horizontal alignment of this element within the space its parent gives it |
| `alignY` | Enum (`top`, `center`, `bottom`) | — | Vertical alignment of this element within the space its parent gives it |
| `alt` | String | `` | The alt text is used by screen readers, or if the image can't be downloaded or displayed |
| `blockTouch` | Boolean | — | Stops every pointer event that lands here from reaching the nodes this one sits inside. Blunt: it takes hover and pointer-down with it, so reach for Click Bubbling first if it is only clicks you want to keep in |
| `borderBottomColor` | Color | — | Colour of the bottom edge only, overriding Border Color |
| `borderBottomLeftRadius` | Number | — | Rounds the bottom-left corner only, overriding Corner Radius |
| `borderBottomRightRadius` | Number | — | Rounds the bottom-right corner only, overriding Corner Radius |
| `borderBottomStyle` | Enum (`none`, `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`) | — | Line style for the bottom edge only, overriding Border Style; None hides that edge |
| `borderBottomWidth` | Number | — | Thickness of the bottom edge in pixels, and it adds to the element's size |
| `borderColor` | Color | `#000000` | Colour of the border, which has no effect while Border Style is None |
| `borderLeftColor` | Color | — | Colour of the left edge only, overriding Border Color |
| `borderLeftStyle` | Enum (`none`, `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`) | — | Line style for the left edge only, overriding Border Style; None hides that edge |
| `borderLeftWidth` | Number | — | Thickness of the left edge in pixels, and it adds to the element's size |
| `borderRadius` | Number | `0` | Rounds all four corners, except any corner that sets its own radius |
| `borderRightColor` | Color | — | Colour of the right edge only, overriding Border Color |
| `borderRightStyle` | Enum (`none`, `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`) | — | Line style for the right edge only, overriding Border Style; None hides that edge |
| `borderRightWidth` | Number | — | Thickness of the right edge in pixels, and it adds to the element's size |
| `borderStyle` | Enum (`none`, `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`) | `none` | Line style for all four edges; None hides the border and leaves Border Width and Color inactive |
| `borderTopColor` | Color | — | Colour of the top edge only, overriding Border Color |
| `borderTopLeftRadius` | Number | — | Rounds the top-left corner only, overriding Corner Radius |
| `borderTopRightRadius` | Number | — | Rounds the top-right corner only, overriding Corner Radius |
| `borderTopStyle` | Enum (`none`, `solid`, `dotted`, `dashed`) | — | Line style for the top edge only, overriding Border Style; None hides that edge |
| `borderTopWidth` | Number | — | Thickness of the top edge in pixels, and it adds to the element's size |
| `borderWidth` | Number | `2` | Thickness of the border in pixels, which adds to the element's size unless Box Sizing accounts for it |
| `boxShadowBlurRadius` | Number | `5` | How soft the shadow edge is; 0 gives a hard edge |
| `boxShadowColor` | Color | `#00000033` | Colour of the shadow, including how transparent it is |

| `boxShadowSpreadRadius` | Number | `2` | How much larger than the element the shadow is drawn |
| `clickBubbling` | Enum (`auto`, `always`, `never`) | `auto` | Whether a click here also fires Click on the nodes this one sits inside. Automatic keeps it here as soon as this node's own Click is connected, so a button inside a clickable card runs the button and not the card; Always is the older behaviour where both run; Never keeps every click here, wired or not. Note that an element at zero opacity takes no pointer events at all |
| `cssClassName` | String | `` | Extra CSS class names to put on this element, for styling from a stylesheet you supply |
| `height` | Dimension | `100` | Height of the element; how the value is read depends on Size Mode |
| `marginBottom` | Number | — | Space outside the element's bottom edge, between it and its neighbours |
| `marginLeft` | Number | — | Space outside the element's left edge, between it and its neighbours |
| `marginRight` | Number | — | Space outside the element's right edge, between it and its neighbours |

| `mounted` | Boolean | `true` | Removes the element from the page entirely when false, unlike Visible which leaves its space behind |
| `objectFit` | Enum (`fill`, `contain`, `cover`, `none`, `scale-down`) | `contain` | How the image fills its box when the two have different proportions; only available with an explicit size |
| `opacity` | Number | `1` | How opaque this element is, from 0 for invisible to 1 for solid |
| `pointerEventsEnabled` | Boolean | `true` | When disabled, mouse and touch events pass through to whatever is behind this element |
| `pointerEventsMode` | Enum (`inherit`, `explicit`) | `inherit` | Whether pointer handling is inherited from the parent or set explicitly on this element |
| `position` | Enum (`relative`, `absolute`, `sticky`, `fixed`) | `relative` | How the element is placed: In Layout follows its siblings, Absolute ignores them, Sticky pins to the parent edge on overflow, Fixed stays put and takes no space |
| `sizeMode` | Enum (`explicit`, `contentWidth`, `contentHeight`, `contentSize`) | `contentSize` | Whether Width and Height are used as given, or the element sizes itself to fit its contents |
| `src` | Image | — | URL or project file to display; leave blank to show nothing rather than request a missing image |

| `transformOriginY` | Number | `50` | Vertical point the element rotates and scales around, as a fraction of its height |
| `transformRotation` | Number | `0` | Rotates the element clockwise in degrees, without affecting the layout |
| `transformScale` | Number | `1` | Scales the element about its transform origin; 1 leaves it unscaled |
| `transformX` | Number | `0` | Moves the element right after layout, without moving its siblings |
| `transformY` | Number | `0` | Moves the element down after layout, without moving its siblings |
| `variant` | String | — | Name of a saved variant of this node type to apply, replacing the styling set here |
| `visible` | Boolean | `true` | Hides the element while keeping the space it occupies in the layout |
| `width` | Dimension | `100` | Width of the element; how the value is read depends on Size Mode |
| `zIndex` | Number | — | Paint order among overlapping siblings; higher numbers paint on top |

## Dynamic ports

_This node's port list changes at runtime (declared-port-groups); the tables above may be incomplete for a given instance._

Declares conditional/expandable port groups whose visibility depends on parameter values (see declaredPortGroups).

| Condition | Inputs shown | Outputs shown |
|---|---|---|
| sizeMode = explicit | `objectFit` | — |
| sizeMode = explicit OR sizeMode = contentHeight | `width` | — |
| sizeMode = explicit OR sizeMode = contentWidth | `height` | — |
| pointerEventsMode = explicit | `pointerEventsEnabled` | — |
| borderStyle = solid OR borderStyle = dashed OR borderStyle = dotted  | `borderWidth`, `borderColor` | — |
| borderLeftStyle = solid OR borderLeftStyle = dashed OR borderLeftStyle = dotted OR borderStyle = solid OR borderStyle = dashed OR borderStyle = dotted  | `borderLeftWidth`, `borderLeftColor` | — |
| borderTopStyle = solid OR borderTopStyle = dashed OR borderTopStyle = dotted OR borderStyle = solid OR borderStyle = dashed OR borderStyle = dotted  | `borderTopWidth`, `borderTopColor` | — |
| borderRightStyle = solid OR borderRightStyle = dashed OR borderRightStyle = dotted OR borderStyle = solid OR borderStyle = dashed OR borderStyle = dotted  | `borderRightWidth`, `borderRightColor` | — |
| borderBottomStyle = solid OR borderBottomStyle = dashed OR borderBottomStyle = dotted OR borderStyle = solid OR borderStyle = dashed OR borderStyle = dotted  | `borderBottomWidth`, `borderBottomColor` | — |
| boxShadowEnabled = true | `boxShadowOffsetX`, `boxShadowOffsetY`, `boxShadowInset`, `boxShadowBlurRadius`, `boxShadowSpreadRadius`, `boxShadowColor` | — |

## Ports at runtime

Declared-port-groups: `objectFit`, `width` and `height` appear based on `sizeMode`; per-side border width/color ports appear once a border style is chosen; box-shadow ports appear when `boxShadowEnabled` is true; `pointerEventsEnabled` appears when `pointerEventsMode` is 'explicit'. Treat the catalog's input list as the superset the editor filters by current parameters.

## Patterns

- Inside a Repeater item component: Component Inputs property → `src` to show per-record images.
- Thumbnail grid: explicit size mode + `objectFit` 'cover' so mixed aspect ratios crop instead of distort.

## Watch out for

- Using Image for icon-font glyphs — net.noodl.visual.icon renders them sharper and tintable via `iconColor`.

## Examples

**Media card row: Columns layout with Image, Icon and Circle**

A card layout composed from the visual primitives: Columns (net.noodl.visual.columns) distributes its children by a layout string ('1 2' — the second column twice as wide), the Image shows a picture from a URL/asset on `src`, the Icon (net.noodl.visual.icon) renders a themed glyph, and the Circle doubles as a status dot whose `fillColor` is data-driven. Layout is containment; only the dynamic bits (image source, status color) are wired.
